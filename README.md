# ELEC5305_ResearchProject_KeywordSpotting
## Research Question 
How can deep learning enhance wake word detection in noisy and real-world audio environments?
## Introduction 
In this inductive research, it focused on the process of training LSTM network to find the factors that affect the performance of the KWS model. The research separated into 3 parts, understanding the concept by reviewing leterature, utilize existing code to build KWS model and create testing code for checking accuracy. The main objective to research and understand what criteria are needed to build a robust wake word detection system. To reach this target, the code aims to evaluate system performance, explore Data augmentation techniques, optimize Hyperparameters, document the Research Process and present research understanding and results. The hypothesis of this research is "The augmented and optimized keyword spotting system will exhibit more accurate and robust solution while using LSTM model with MFCC acoustic features". The accuracy and robutness of the network will be check with confusion chart and plotting audio-mask graph.
